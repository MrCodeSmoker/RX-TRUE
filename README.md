 The Blockchain-Integrated Prescription System uses NLP to extract drug details (name, dosage, frequency, duration) from prescriptions and securely stores them on blockchain to ensure immutability and authenticity.Through a Streamlit-based interface, doctors can issue prescriptions, pharmacists can verify them, and patients can access their records, reducing fraud, errors, and improving trust in healthcare.
